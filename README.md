The purpose of this project is to initially test our knowledge of the building blocks of the Web (ie. HTML, CSS, and JS) and how to consume API's in order to create a unique web application specific to a need we see.

## User Story

AS AN avid media consumer who's run through all their queues
I WANT to be able to get recommendations for like media I already enjoy
SO THAT I can continue to not go insane during COVID while staying entertained
```

GIVEN I am using a content recommendation engine to seek new media
WHEN I arrive at the page
THEN I am presented with the option to search for a given media type (Book, Movie, Music)
WHEN I enter input
THEN I am then given relevant recommendations based on the selected media types
WHEN I click on any of the recommendations given
THEN I am presented with relevant content information (Ex. Albums, Artist Info, YT Link to Popular song)
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the previously searched content will be cleared from the screen but remain in memory to be searched on again
```
