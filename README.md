# Ask Winston: Music Recommendation Search Engine

## Description

The purpose of this project is to initially test our knowledge of the building blocks of the Web (ie. HTML, CSS, and JS) and how to consume API's in order to create a unique web application specific to a need we see.

Given that each one of us are big consumers of music we thought a recommendation engine based on an artist or song you already enjoy would be a good way to start. The application is primarily built upon the LastFM and Napster API's. When a Artist or Artist/Song combo is input by the user, the applications queries the LastFM API and it's Similar Artist call to give us information. With that in hand, the application then leverages the Napster API to pull all relevant information for that intial call and display it to the user. The user is then allowed to search at their leisure and even enjoy quick song previews with song lyrics as well.

Many positives were gained out of this project. First and foremost was learning how to work as part of a dev team. With different schedules, lifestyles, and availability, accurate planning and communication were of the utmost importance and probably one of the major takeaways from this. Identifying workflow and properly resolving branch related conflict is another thing I believe we were able to come out of this stronger with. Finally, combing through documentation and simply putting in the time to research was displayed and learned throughout this entire process.
